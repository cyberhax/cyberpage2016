<Strong>Description:</Strong>
    <p>Network forensics is a sub-branch of digital forensics relating to the monitoring and analysis of computer network traffic 
    for the purposes of information gathering, legal evidence, or intrusion detection. Unlike other areas of digital forensics, 
    	network investigations deal with volatile and dynamic information. Network traffic is transmitted and then lost, 
    so network forensics is often a pro-active investigation. 
	Network forensics generally has two uses. The first, relating to security, involves monitoring a network for anomalous traffic 
	and identifying intrusions. An attacker might be able to erase all log files on a compromised host; network-based evidence 
	might therefore be the only evidence available for forensic analysis. The second form relates to law enforcement. 
	In this case analysis of captured network traffic can include tasks such as reassembling transferred files, 
	searching for keywords and parsing human communication such as emails or chat sessions.</p>

    <Strong>What this module aim for:</Strong>
    <p>Analyzing communication protocol is part of our life nowadays. As all our interaction is being recorded by some party 
    through each medium. Thus each message we delivered must have a medium. Analyzing this network communication is 
    beneficial for security networkers as far to track down an enemy/terrorist/bombers sniff out of their 
    criminal activities. On the privacy site, covering our communication protocol might prevent any 
    third party from sniff out our interaction.</p>
