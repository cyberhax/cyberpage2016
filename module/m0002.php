<Strong>Description:</Strong>
    <p>Conversion of information from a readable state to apparent nonsense. The originator of an encrypted message shared the 
    decoding technique needed to recover the original information only with intended recipients, thereby precluding unwanted 
    persons from doing the same.With this we can increase the security,integrity and privacy of the message.</p>

    <Strong>What this module aim for:</Strong>
    <p>To develop a well-rounded student in the area of data encryption and algorithm as this will greatly reduce the 
    problem of data leakage out of a system. A good encryption is the encryption that is non-breakable even by 
    their own developer. Thus various types of encryption being made in the way to craft a good well 
    protection for the data/secret.</p>
