    <Strong>What this module aim for:</Strong>
    <p>It is the original windows programming system which will be beneficial for students nowadays to learn. Having expert in 
    Batch programming algorithm is quite useful as allow users to reverse engineer the program itself. Having to know specific 
    input which will allow client to have Administrative access to such a program is quite troublesome if batch programming 
    algorithm is not properly prepared.</p>
